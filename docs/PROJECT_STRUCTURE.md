# EduScan project structure

This guide explains how EduScan is organized, how a request moves through the system, and what each maintained project file is responsible for. Runtime databases, encrypted biometric artifacts, generated reports, logs, dependency folders, and local secrets are intentionally excluded from Git.

## System overview

EduScan is a local-first client-server application with layered responsibilities:

1. The React client renders role-based administrator, teacher, gate-scanner, records-officer, privacy-officer, and ICT interfaces.
2. `src/api/client.js` sends authenticated HTTP requests to the local FastAPI server.
3. FastAPI endpoints validate requests, enforce roles, and delegate work to backend services.
4. Service modules implement attendance, LBPH biometrics, SMS, spreadsheet reporting, imports, backups, disposal, and scheduling.
5. SQLAlchemy persists structured records in SQLite by default or in the configured MySQL server through `DATABASE_URL`.
6. Encrypted face samples and LBPH model artifacts are stored outside the web root, while their metadata and audit history are stored in SQL.

The normal single-laptop deployment uses these local addresses:

- Web client: `http://127.0.0.1:5174`
- Backend API: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api`
- API documentation: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

Internet access is not required for the core application after dependencies are installed. Android SMS delivery requires only a local network connection to the gateway phone and cellular SMS service. External reference links require internet access, but the interface uses offline system fonts.

## Request and data flow

```text
Browser interface
    -> src/api/client.js
    -> FastAPI routes in backend/app/main.py
    -> role checks and Pydantic request validation
    -> backend service module
    -> SQLAlchemy / SQLite or MySQL and encrypted local artifacts
    -> JSON, XLSX, or file response
    -> browser interface
```

Gate recognition follows a specialized path:

```text
Camera frame
    -> browser JPEG capture
    -> POST /api/biometrics/recognize-many
    -> Haar face detection
    -> LBPH prediction for each detected face
    -> duplicate suppression, confidence checks, and blink-based liveness state
    -> duplicate cooldown and automatic time-in/time-out alternation
    -> optional guardian SMS outbox and Android gateway dispatch
```

## Runtime data not committed to Git

The following paths are created locally and should not be published:

- `backend/.env` — local secrets and deployment settings.
- `backend/.venv/` — installed Python environment.
- `backend/data/eduscan.db` and its WAL/SHM files — live SQLite records.
- `backend/data/.encryption_key` — key required to decrypt biometric samples and models.
- `backend/data/.app_secret` — generated per-installation token-signing secret when an environment secret is not supplied.
- `backend/data/biometrics/` — encrypted face samples.
- `backend/data/models/` — encrypted LBPH model versions.
- `backend/data/exports/` — generated temporary logs and SF2 workbooks.
- `backend/data/backups/` — encrypted backup packages.
- `logs/` — local API and frontend process output.
- `node_modules/` and `dist/` — installed frontend dependencies and generated build output.

The approved workbook at `backend/data/templates/School Form 2 (SF2) Daily Attendance Report of Learners.xlsx` is intentionally retained because the report generator requires its official structure.

## Scanner camera update

The current gate-station interface provides:

- a larger 16:9 camera workspace with a responsive minimum height;
- more horizontal space for recognizing several people in one frame;
- a whole-frame multi-face positioning guide instead of a single-face oval;
- a full-screen button inside the camera and an additional expand control below it;
- a browser-support warning if the Fullscreen API is unavailable; and
- a narrower recent-events panel so the camera remains the primary gate-station surface.

These presentation changes are located only in `src/pages/Scanner/Scanner.jsx` and `src/styles/index.css`. Recognition processing continues to use the existing local multi-face LBPH endpoint.
